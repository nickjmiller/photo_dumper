- [x] Proper state management with BLoC
- [x] Comprehensive testing
- [x] UI polish and centering fixes

## üöß Phase 2: Enhanced Photo Comparison (IN PROGRESS)

### Core Comparison Logic
- [ ] Update Photo Comparison BLoC with new events:
  - `LoadSelectedPhotos` - Initialize comparison with selected photos
  - `SelectWinner` - Choose winner between two photos
  - `NextPair` - Move to next random pair
  - `RestartComparison` - Start over with same photos
- [ ] Add new states:
  - `ComparisonInProgress` - Show current pair being compared
  - `ComparisonComplete` - Show final winner
  - `NoMorePairs` - Handle edge cases

### Random Pair Selection
- [ ] Implement tournament-style elimination algorithm
- [ ] Generate random pairs from selected photos
- [ ] Track eliminated photos
- [ ] Handle cases with odd number of photos
- [ ] Ensure each photo gets fair comparison opportunities

### Updated Photo Comparison Page
- [ ] Accept `selectedPhotos` parameter from Phase 1
- [ ] Show random pairs from selected photos instead of fixed pairs
- [ ] Update UI to display current pair number (e.g., "Comparison 3 of 12")
- [ ] Add progress indicator showing remaining photos
- [ ] Replace "Keep Both" and "Discard Both" with single photo selection
- [ ] Add "Skip" option for difficult decisions

### Action Buttons Update
- [ ] Replace current action buttons with:
  - "Choose Left Photo" button
  - "Choose Right Photo" button  
  - "Skip This Pair" button (moves both to next round)
  - "Restart Comparison" button

## üìä Phase 3: UI/UX Enhancements

### Photo Selection UI Improvements
- [ ] Add search/filter functionality for large photo libraries
- [ ] Implement photo sorting options (date, name, size)
- [ ] Add batch selection tools (select all, select by date range)
- [ ] Show photo metadata (date taken, file size)
- [ ] Add preview modal for better photo viewing

### Enhanced Comparison UI
- [ ] Implement smooth transitions between photo pairs
- [ ] Add photo zoom/pan functionality for detailed viewing
- [ ] Show photo metadata during comparison
- [ ] Add comparison history/undo functionality
- [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts for power users
- [ ] Add auto-advance timer option

### Progress and Statistics
- [ ] Detailed progress bar with percentage completion
- [ ] Show estimated time remaining
- [ ] Display comparison statistics (total comparisons made)
- [ ] Add session summary with eliminated photos count
- [ ] Show comparison speed metrics

### Winner Celebration
- [ ] Create animated winner reveal screen
- [ ] Show finalist photos leading to winner
- [ ] Add sharing functionality for the winning photo
- [ ] Option to save winner to a special album
- [ ] Confetti animation and celebratory UI

## üß™ Phase 4: Testing and Polish

### Comprehensive Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for tournament algorithm
- [ ] Widget tests for all comparison UI components
- [ ] Integration tests for complete photo selection to winner flow
- [ ] Performance tests with large photo sets (100+ photos)
- [ ] Memory usage optimization tests

### Edge Case Handling
- [ ] Single photo selection (auto-declare winner)
- [ ] Two photo selection (simple head-to-head)
- [ ] Handling of corrupted or unloadable images
- [ ] App state persistence during interruptions
- [ ] Graceful handling of permission revocation

### User Experience Testing
- [ ] Usability testing with real users
- [ ] Performance optimization for older devices
- [ ] Accessibility improvements (screen readers, high contrast)
- [ ] Different screen size adaptations
- [ ] Dark mode support

### Error Handling and Recovery
- [ ] Robust error messages for common issues
- [ ] Automatic retry mechanisms for failed operations
- [ ] Offline mode considerations
- [ ] Data recovery options for interrupted sessions

## üöÄ Phase 5: Advanced Features (Future Enhancements)

### Smart Comparison Features
- [ ] AI-powered photo quality assessment
- [ ] Automatic duplicate photo detection
- [ ] Similarity-based grouping before comparison
- [ ] Face detection for people-focused comparisons
- [ ] Scene recognition for landscape photos

### Export and Sharing
- [ ] Export winning photos to new album
- [ ] Share comparison results on social media
- [ ] Generate comparison summary reports
- [ ] Backup/restore comparison sessions
- [ ] Export eliminated photos for deletion

### Advanced Algorithms
- [ ] ELO rating system for more sophisticated ranking
- [ ] Machine learning from user preferences
- [ ] Weighted comparisons based on photo characteristics
- [ ] Group comparison modes (family vs landscapes)
- [ ] Tournament bracket visualization

### Platform Integration
- [ ] iCloud/Google Photos sync
- [ ] Cross-device session continuity
- [ ] Apple Watch quick decisions
- [ ] Widget for quick photo comparisons
- [ ] Shortcuts app integration

## üìù Technical Debt and Optimization

### Code Quality
- [ ] Refactor repository pattern for better testability
- [ ] Implement proper logging throughout the app
- [ ] Add analytics for user behavior insights
- [ ] Optimize image loading and caching strategies
- [ ] Implement proper dependency injection patterns

### Performance Optimizations
