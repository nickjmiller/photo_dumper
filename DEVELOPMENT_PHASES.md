# Photo Dumper - Development Phases

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Photo Selection Feature (COMPLETED)
- [x] Create Photo Selection Page with grid layout
- [x] Real photo library integration using image_picker
- [x] Permission handling for photo library access
- [x] Multi-selection capability with visual indicators
- [x] Add more photos functionality
- [x] Clear all selections feature
- [x] Proper state management with BLoC
- [x] Comprehensive testing
- [x] UI polish and centering fixes

## üöß Phase 2: Enhanced Photo Comparison (IN PROGRESS)

### Core Comparison Logic
- [ ] Update Photo Comparison BLoC with new events:
  - `LoadSelectedPhotos` - Initialize comparison with selected photos
  - `SelectWinner` - Choose winner between two photos
  - `KeepBoth` - Remove both photos from competition
  - `NextPair` - Move to next random pair
  - `RestartComparison` - Start over with same photos
  - `ConfirmDeletion` - Confirm deletion of eliminated photos
- [ ] Add new states:
  - `RoundOneInProgress` - First round: eliminate or skip
  - `RoundTwoInProgress` - Second round: eliminate or keep both
  - `DeletionConfirmation` - Show eliminated photos for confirmation
  - `ComparisonComplete` - Show final kept photos
  - `NoMorePairs` - Handle edge cases

### Two-Round Photo Comparison
- [ ] Implement two-round elimination algorithm
- [ ] Round 1: Generate random pairs, eliminate or skip photos
- [ ] Round 2: Generate pairs from remaining photos, eliminate or keep both
- [ ] Track eliminated, kept, and skipped photos separately
- [ ] Handle odd number of photos with automatic advancement
- [ ] Ensure each photo gets fair comparison opportunities in both rounds

### Updated Photo Comparison Page
- [ ] Accept `selectedPhotos` parameter from Phase 1
- [ ] Show current round indicator (Round 1 or Round 2)
- [ ] Update UI to display current comparison (e.g., "Round 1: Comparison 3 of 12")
- [ ] Add progress indicator showing remaining photos in current round
- [ ] Round 1: "Choose Left", "Choose Right", "Skip This Pair"
- [ ] Round 2: "Choose Left", "Choose Right", "Keep Both"
- [ ] Show transition screen between rounds

### Action Buttons Update
- [ ] Keep existing swiping mechanism for photo selection:
  - Swipe left to choose left photo (eliminates right photo)
  - Swipe right to choose right photo (eliminates left photo)
- [ ] Round 1 additional buttons:
  - "Skip This Pair" button (advances both to Round 2)
  - "Restart Comparison" button
- [ ] Round 2 additional buttons:
  - "Keep Both" button (removes both from competition)
  - "Restart Comparison" button

## üìä Phase 3: UI/UX Enhancements

### Photo Selection UI Improvements
- [ ] Add search/filter functionality for large photo libraries
- [ ] Implement photo sorting options (date, name, size)
- [ ] Add batch selection tools (select all, select by date range)
- [ ] Show photo metadata (date taken, file size)
- [ ] Add preview modal for better photo viewing

### Enhanced Comparison UI
- [ ] Implement smooth transitions between photo pairs
- [ ] Add photo zoom/pan functionality for detailed viewing
- [ ] Show photo metadata during comparison
- [ ] Add comparison history/undo functionality
- [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts for power users
- [ ] Add auto-advance timer option

### Progress and Statistics
- [ ] Detailed progress bar with percentage completion
- [ ] Show estimated time remaining
- [ ] Display comparison statistics (total comparisons made)
- [ ] Add session summary with eliminated photos count
- [ ] Show comparison speed metrics

### Deletion Confirmation Screen
- [ ] Create deletion confirmation screen showing all eliminated photos
- [ ] Display count of photos to be deleted vs kept
- [ ] Allow user to review and modify selections before deletion
- [ ] Add "Confirm Delete" and "Cancel" buttons
- [ ] Show preview of photos that will be kept

## üß™ Phase 4: Testing and Polish

### Comprehensive Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for comparison algorithm
- [ ] Widget tests for all comparison UI components
- [ ] Integration tests for complete photo selection to winner flow
- [ ] Performance tests with large photo sets (100+ photos)
- [ ] Memory usage optimization tests

### Edge Case Handling
- [ ] Single photo selection (auto-keep)
- [ ] Two photo selection (simple head-to-head)
- [ ] All photos skipped in Round 1 (auto-advance to Round 2)
- [ ] All photos kept in Round 2 (no deletion needed)
- [ ] Handling of corrupted or unloadable images
- [ ] App state persistence during interruptions
- [ ] Graceful handling of permission revocation

### User Experience Testing
- [ ] Usability testing with real users
- [ ] Performance optimization for older devices
- [ ] Accessibility improvements (screen readers, high contrast)
- [ ] Different screen size adaptations
- [ ] Dark mode support

### Error Handling and Recovery
- [ ] Robust error messages for common issues
- [ ] Automatic retry mechanisms for failed operations
- [ ] Offline mode considerations
- [ ] Data recovery options for interrupted sessions

## üöÄ Phase 5: Advanced Features (Future Enhancements)

### Smart Comparison Features
- [ ] AI-powered photo quality assessment
- [ ] Automatic duplicate photo detection
- [ ] Similarity-based grouping before comparison
- [ ] Face detection for people-focused comparisons
- [ ] Scene recognition for landscape photos

### Export and Sharing
- [ ] Export winning photos to new album
- [ ] Share comparison results on social media
- [ ] Generate comparison summary reports
- [ ] Backup/restore comparison sessions
- [ ] Export eliminated photos for deletion

### Advanced Algorithms
- [ ] ELO rating system for more sophisticated ranking
- [ ] Machine learning from user preferences
- [ ] Weighted comparisons based on photo characteristics
- [ ] Group comparison modes (family vs landscapes)
- [ ] Comparison history visualization

### Platform Integration
